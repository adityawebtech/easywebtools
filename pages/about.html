      <p>Welcome to <strong>Toolswagon</strong> – a simple, fast, and growing collection of free online tools designed to make your digital life easier. Whether you're converting text cases, working with code, or exploring creative tasks, we provide minimal yet powerful tools built with a passion for solving everyday digital problems.</p>

      <h2>Meet the Creator</h2>
      <p>Hi, I'm <strong>Aditya Pal</strong> – a freelance web developer, blogger, and an electrical engineer by qualification. I've been coding and creating on the web since <strong>2017</strong>. With a strong technical background and an even stronger passion for the internet, I love building clean, user-friendly tools and websites that serve real people with real needs.</p>

      <p>What started as a curiosity for web design and blogging during my engineering days eventually turned into a full-time journey. Today, I blend logic with creativity – from writing helpful content to developing functional, fast-loading tools that anyone can use.</p>

      <p>Toolswagon is a personal initiative – not a giant tech company. Every tool here is built, tested, and improved by me with one mission in mind: <em>to provide value without clutter or complexity.</em></p>

      <h2>Why Toolswagon?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Lightweight tools with zero distractions</li>
        <li>No login, no hassle – just get things done</li>
        <li>Fast load times and mobile-friendly design</li>
        <li>Built and maintained by a solo creator who cares</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Let’s Connect</h2>
      <p>I always appreciate feedback, suggestions, and collaboration. If you have ideas or just want to say hello, reach out at <strong>contact@toolswagon.site</strong> or follow my work online.</p>
